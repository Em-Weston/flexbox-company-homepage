# Company Home Page with Flexbox
-----

In this project, I will be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. I can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company! ​
I imagined my own company, which sells eco-friendly dog grooming products.

## Room For Improvement
----

* I feel mysite is not an elborate use of flexbox. I could utalise flex-grow and flex-shrink more. 
* I use a very simple colour and design system. Hex colours: #575757, #DEE1D4 and #FFFFFF
* I could think of something more creative for the company name, and could use a really Elaborate font to make it more eye-catching.
